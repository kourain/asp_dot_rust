# Changelog

## 0.2.7

- Built-in attribute macros such as `#[max_body_size(..)]` are `#[attr(name = value)]` with a typed value; they are declared in one place (`for_each_attr_alias!` in `controller/extra_attribute.rs` of the macros crate) and need no import of `attr`.
- `#[attr(key = value, ...)]` sets attributes of a route, on the controller impl as defaults for its routes or on an action to override a key. A value is stored as its own type and read back as exactly that type (`5` is an `i32`, `5u8` a `u8`) with `HttpRequest::route_attribute::<T>(key)`, `HttpRequest::route_attributes()` or `Route::attributes()`.

## 0.2.6

- Add #[middleware] at top impl middleware

## 0.2.5

- Allow controller_route auto asign empty default root route ("")
